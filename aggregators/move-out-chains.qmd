# Overview

Move-out chains (also called vacancy chains) occur when new housing construction induces a cascade of moves throughout a local housing market. When someone moves into a new unit, they vacate their previous home, which may then be occupied by another household who also vacates their prior residence, creating a chain of housing opportunities. This aggregator collects all primary notes examining the empirical evidence on vacancy chains and housing filtering.

# Key Insights

The empirical literature on vacancy chains reveals several important findings:

1. **Substantial multiplier effects**: New housing construction can generate vacancy chains that exceed the number of units built, with multiplier effects varying by local market conditions and data coverage.

2. **Comparable effects across subsidy types**: Both market-rate and income-restricted units generate significant vacancy chains, though income-restricted units may have lower vacancy rates per unit due to new household formation.

3. **Geographic dispersion**: Vacancy chains spread across significant distances, demonstrating that new construction can affect housing availability well beyond the immediate neighborhood.

4. **Housing stock filtering**: Vacancy chains tend to free up older, existing housing stock, contributing to the overall supply of available housing across different price points and vintages.
