## Note A: Rent control compresses **controlled rents** but often pushes up **uncontrolled rents** (net rent effect depends on market segmentation)

### Summary
Across the empirical literature reviewed, rent control is consistently associated with *lower* rents in the regulated (“controlled”) segment, while effects in the unregulated (“uncontrolled”) segment tend to go in the opposite direction (often higher rents) or sometimes show no statistically significant change. The paper emphasizes that you can’t infer the *overall* rent effect without knowing how the housing stock is split between controlled vs uncontrolled units and how that split evolves with policy design and time.

### Details
The paper distinguishes **controlled rents** (paid by tenants in regulated units) from **uncontrolled rents** (paid in non-regulated units, often newer or luxury stock, or otherwise exempt units). 

**Controlled rents: strong consensus on rent-reducing effects.**  
The review reports a largely unambiguous pattern: **36 of 41 published studies** find a statistically significant *negative* effect of rent control on controlled rents (i.e., regulated rents are lower than they otherwise would be).   
The paper also names several published studies that find **no effect** on controlled rents (listed as exceptions): **Gilderbloom (1986), Malard & Poulhes (2020), Oni (2008), and Oust (2018a)**. 

**Uncontrolled rents: majority of studies find increases, but not unanimity.**  
For rents in the uncontrolled segment, the paper summarizes that about **65% of published studies** find a statistically significant *positive* effect (uncontrolled rents rise), **~26%** find no statistically significant effect, and **~8%** find a negative effect.   
It highlights one published study that finds **no statistically significant effect** of rent control on uncontrolled rents: **Bonneval et al. (2021)** (Lyon, 1890–1968; property manager accounting books; DiD panel approach).   
*Controversial / context-sensitive:* the uncontrolled-rent result is more heterogeneous and plausibly depends on segmentation, exemptions, and demand spillovers; the paper frames this as a common source of disagreement across settings rather than a single settled parameter. 

**Effect sizes vary widely; averages exist but aren’t “the answer.”**  
The paper reports ranges across studies: controlled-rent effects from **−57% to −1%**, and uncontrolled-rent effects from **−2% to +14.8%**. It also reports average effects of **−9.4%** (controlled) and **+4.8%** (uncontrolled).   
But it stresses that these averages are insufficient to assess overall rent impacts without analyzing the **distribution of units across controlled vs uncontrolled sectors**, which depends heavily on policy design (and can change over time). 

**Data availability note (when identifiable in-paper):**  
For some highlighted studies, the paper describes sources but does not always state whether they are publicly accessible (e.g., “property manager’s accounting books” suggests restricted access). 


## Note B: Rent control is commonly associated with reduced new construction / supply, but results are mixed

### Summary
The review finds that rent control is **often** linked to reductions in new residential construction and housing supply, though a non-trivial share of studies find no statistically significant effect. The paper argues this mixed picture can arise from policy design (e.g., exemptions) and from measurement choices (total construction vs rental construction).

### Details
The paper reports that for **new residential construction and supply**, **about two-thirds** of studies find a **negative** impact, while several studies find **no statistically significant effect**. 

It offers two main explanations for heterogeneity:
1) **Policy design differences** (e.g., exemptions for new stock), and  
2) **Outcome definition / data limitations**—rent control may depress **rental** construction while **owner-occupied** construction rises, and many studies measure only **overall** completions due to data constraints, potentially masking substitution. 

The paper further notes that government intervention (public housing construction or subsidies for social housing) could stabilize or increase total completions even if private rental construction falls, which could be misread as a “beneficial” construction effect if one only looks at totals. 


## Note C: Exempting newly constructed housing can mute rent control’s construction effects

### Summary
One reason construction/supply effects differ across studies is that many rent control systems **exclude new construction**, so affected stock and investor incentives vary sharply by policy design.

### Details
The paper explicitly notes that some rent control policies **exempt newly constructed housing**, leaving it “unaffected by rent control regulations,” which can weaken measured impacts on construction or shift effects into older vintages only. 


## Note D: Rent control tends to reduce housing quality unless rules peg allowed rent increases to improvements

### Summary
The review reports near-unanimity among published studies that rent control is associated with **deterioration in housing quality**, with a couple of published exceptions. Mechanistically, the paper emphasizes landlord incentives: lower regulated revenue reduces maintenance and refurbishment. A theoretical design tweak—linking allowable increases to landlord improvements—could prevent quality decline.

### Details
**Empirical direction (published studies):**  
The paper states that published studies are “almost unanimous” that rent control reduces housing quality, with exceptions **Gilderbloom (1986)** and **Gilderbloom & Markham (1996)**, which argue moderate rent control does not impact quality. 

**Mechanism (incentives and “wearing out”):**  
It explains the core mechanism: rent control erodes landlords’ revenues, reducing incentives to invest in maintenance and refurbishment, so properties are allowed to “wear out” until real value aligns with low real rent. 

**Design mitigation (theoretical):**  
A theoretical study by **Lind (2015)** is cited as showing quality need not suffer if allowed rent increases are **pegged to improvements** made by landlords. 

**Unpublished studies:**  
When including unpublished work, the paper reports mixed results (about half negative, half no effects). 


## Note E: Rent control can reduce property values by lowering expected discounted rental income

### Summary
The paper argues that rent control can lower the market value of rental properties because value reflects discounted expectations of future rental earnings. Institutional features like stronger tenure security can amplify this.

### Details
The paper states that property value can be understood as the discounted sum of expected future rents; therefore, policies that reduce expected rental income tend to reduce property values. It explicitly links reduced values to fixing rents at low levels and constraining rent hikes, and notes effects can be stronger when paired with higher tenure security. 


## Note F: Tenant-occupied dwellings may trade at a discount under strong tenant protections (example: 27% discount)

### Summary
The paper gives a concrete example of how tenant protections (often bundled with rent regulation) can reduce sale prices: a tenant-occupied unit may be harder to empty, so buyers pay less.

### Details
The paper cites **Kholodilin et al. (2017)** as finding that a **tenant-occupied dwelling** sells at a **27% discount**, partially reflecting the difficulty of evicting sitting tenants due to legal protections. 


## Note G: Effects of rent control on homeownership are directionally mixed

### Summary
Unlike controlled-rent and housing-quality effects, the literature reviewed does not converge cleanly on the sign of rent control’s homeownership effects.

### Details
The paper states that “the picture is a bit less clear cut” for homeownership: multiple studies point in different directions, and the relationship becomes especially blurred when only unpublished studies are considered.   
Table entries in the paper illustrate that published results can go either way in specific contexts (e.g., San Francisco and Berkeley examples appear with opposite directions). 


## Note H: Rent control can misallocate housing and reduce residential mobility (via lock-in and tenure stability)

### Summary
The paper frames rent control as creating excess demand and “lock-in,” which can misallocate housing (units mismatched to household needs) and reduce mobility. It also emphasizes that reduced mobility can arise both from rent advantages (fear of losing a bargain) and from longer tenure stability (including eviction protections).

### Details
**Misallocation mechanism (mismatch):**  
The paper gives a canonical misallocation example: an elderly widow remains in a large rent-controlled apartment long after it’s needed, while larger households search desperately for appropriately sized units. 

**Mobility: empirical consensus is strongly negative.**  
It reports that “nearly all studies” find a **negative** effect of rent control on residential mobility, with essentially no positive findings; only two studies are noted as finding statistically insignificant effects (Lambie-Hanson 2008; Linneman 1987), along with commentary about their methods. 

**Why mobility falls (two channels):**
1) **Lock-in from rent advantages:** tenants hesitate to move because comparable quality at similarly low rent may be hard to find.   
2) **Tenure stability / protection:** rent regulation reduces financial strain and eviction likelihood, and rent-control regimes often coincide with stronger protections against arbitrary removals, leading to longer duration in place. 


## Note I: Reduced residential mobility can impair labor-market adjustment

### Summary
The paper argues that if rent control decreases residential mobility, it can also reduce labor mobility, making workers less responsive to geographic shifts in job opportunities.

### Details
The theory section explicitly links reduced housing mobility to decreased labor mobility.   
Later, the paper reiterates a labor-market channel: when conditions worsen in a city, tenants in controlled dwellings may be less inclined to move to areas with better employment prospects, which can produce adverse labor-market outcomes by limiting adjustment. 


## Note J: Rent control can reduce tax revenues via landlord profits and property tax bases

### Summary
The paper describes two primary mechanisms by which rent control can reduce the tax base: lower landlord profits (reducing profit taxation) and lower property values (reducing property-tax revenue).

### Details
The paper defines “tax base effects” as changes in tax revenues caused by rent control and lists two main pathways: (1) reduced landlord earnings cut taxation revenue from profits, and (2) reduced property values under regulation reduce revenue from property taxes. It notes these should be included in overall welfare calculations. 


## Note K: Rent control can increase commuting times by reducing mobility

### Summary
If households are “locked in” to regulated units, they may remain far from jobs rather than relocating closer, potentially increasing commuting time.

### Details
The paper defines commuting-time effects as the possibility that reduced residential mobility encourages people to stay in regulated homes rather than move nearer to their workplaces, increasing commuting time.   
*(No specific empirical reference was located in the cited passages; the paper presents this as a plausible channel within a “miscellaneous” effects discussion.)* 


## Note L: Housing shortages under rent control can delay marriage (demographic channel)

### Summary
The paper suggests rent control–related shortages can affect demographic decisions, such as delaying marriage if young people cannot secure independent housing.

### Details
As a mechanism, the paper states that limited rental housing availability can cause young people to postpone marriage in contexts where living separately from parents is culturally expected.   
It also lists at least one empirical study examining this channel: **Assaad et al. (2021)** (Egypt; DiD; “marriage” outcome). 


## Note M: Rent control can generate black-market “side payments” (e.g., key money)

### Summary
When regulated rents create excess demand, informal payments may emerge as a rationing device—one example is key money, a nonrefundable deposit paid upon moving in.

### Details
In the theory discussion, the paper states that black-market practices like demanding “key money” can emerge in response to distortions created by artificially low rents.   
The paper’s appendix table also includes empirical work explicitly studying **side payments** (e.g., **Malpezzi (1998)** in Cairo, listed as examining controlled rents and side payments).
