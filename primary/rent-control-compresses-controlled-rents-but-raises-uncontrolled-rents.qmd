# Summary

In a meta-study, [rent control](../aggregators/rent-control.qmd) was found to be consistently associated with lower rents in the regulated ("controlled") segment but higher rents in the unregulated ("uncontrolled") segment [@Kholodilin2024].

# Details

Kholodilin found that **36 of 41 published studies** show a statistically significant *negative* effect of rent control on controlled rents (i.e., regulated rents are lower than they otherwise would be), ranging from **−57% to −1%**. For rents in the uncontrolled segment, about **65% of published studies** find a statistically significant *positive* effect (uncontrolled rents rise), **~26%** find no statistically significant effect, and **~8%** find a negative effect, with a range of **−2% to +14.8%** [@Kholodilin2024].
