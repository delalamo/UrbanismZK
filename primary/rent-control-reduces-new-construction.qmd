# Summary

A meta-review of over 100 case studies found that [rent control](../aggregators/rent-control.qmd) is **often** linked to reductions in new residential construction and housing supply, with about two-thirds finding a statistically significant negative impact [@Kholodilin2024]. This could be tied to [lower property values for rent-controlled building](tenant-occupied-dwelling-price-discount.qmd).
