# Summary

Homes vacated during [move-out chains](../aggregators/move-out-chains.qmd) tend to be substantially older than new units.

# Details

In a case study of a 512-unit condominium tower in Honolulu, vacated homes had average construction year of 1985 (Round 1) and 1987 (Round 2) [@FangKimTyndall2025]. Income-restricted chains involved even older units: 1979 for Round 1. Given that Honolulu's median housing unit was constructed in 1977, the pattern demonstrates new units freeing up significantly older stock.
