# Summary

[Rent control](../aggregators/rent-control.qmd) was found to be strongly associated with **deterioration in housing quality** by a meta-review of over 100 case studies [@Kholodilin2024]. Lower regulated revenue leads to reduced maintenance and refurbishment.

# Details

## Empirical direction (published studies)

The author of the meta-review, Kholodilin, states that published studies are "almost unanimous" that rent control reduces housing quality, with notable exceptions by Gilderbloom [@Gilderbloom1986] and Gilderbloom & Markham [@GilderbloomMarkham1996], which argue moderate rent control does not impact quality [@Kholodilin2024].

## Mechanism (incentives and "wearing out")

Kholodilin explains the core mechanism: rent control erodes landlords' revenues, reducing incentives to invest in maintenance and refurbishment, so properties are allowed to "wear out" until real value aligns with low real rent [@Kholodilin2024].

## Design mitigation (theoretical)

A theoretical study by Lind [@Lind2015] is cited by Kholodilin as showing quality need not suffer if allowed rent increases are **pegged to improvements** made by landlords [@Kholodilin2024]. This creates a direct financial incentive for maintenance and upgrades.

## Unpublished studies

When including unpublished work, Kholodilin reports mixed results (about half negative, half no effects) [@Kholodilin2024].
