# Summary

[Rent control](../aggregators/rent-control.qmd) was found to be strongly associated with **deterioration in housing quality** by a meta-review of over 100 case studies [@Kholodilin2024]. Lower regulated revenue leads to reduced maintenance and refurbishment, due to expectations of lower revenue.

# Details

The author of the meta-review, Kholodilin, states that published studies are "almost unanimous" that rent control reduces housing quality, with notable exceptions by Gilderbloom [@Gilderbloom1986] and Gilderbloom & Markham [@GilderbloomMarkham1996], which argue moderate rent control does not impact quality [@Kholodilin2024]. A theoretical study by Lind [@Lind2015] shows quality need not suffer if allowed rent increases are **pegged to improvements** made by landlords.
