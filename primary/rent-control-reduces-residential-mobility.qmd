# Summary

[Rent control](../aggregators/rent-control.qmd) creates excess demand and "lock-in," leading to misallocated housing (units mismatched to household needs) and reduced mobility [@Kholodilin2024]. Reduced mobility can arise both from rent advantages (fear of losing a bargain) and from longer tenure stability (including eviction protections).

# Details

In a meta-review of over 100 case studies on the effects of rent control, "nearly all" found a **negative** effect on residential mobility, with essentially no positive findings [@Kholodilin2024]. Only two studies are noted as finding statistically insignificant effects [@LambieHanson2008; @Linneman1987].
