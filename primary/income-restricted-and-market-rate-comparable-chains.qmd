# Summary

Both market-rate and below-market-rate housing generate comparable [move-out chains](../aggregators/move-out-chains.qmd).

# Details

In a case study of a 512-unit condominium tower in Honolulu, both market-rate units (202 units) and income-restricted units (310 units) generated substantial vacancy chains [@FangKimTyndall2025]. Market-rate units produced 0.43 vacancies per unit while income-restricted units produced 0.29 per unit. However, when vacancies actually occurred, both unit types reached similar price points in the lower-cost housing market.
