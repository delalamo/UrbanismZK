# Summary

[Rent control](../aggregators/rent-control.qmd)–related shortages can affect demographic decisions, such as delaying marriage if young people cannot secure independent housing.

# Details

This effect is likely to be:

- Stronger in cultures where marriage is closely tied to establishing independent housing
- More pronounced when rent control creates severe housing shortages
- Amplified when combined with other barriers to household formation (e.g., high unemployment, limited credit)

The marriage delay effect represents a spillover from housing policy to demographic patterns, potentially affecting fertility rates.
