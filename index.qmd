# Welcome

This is a Quarto-based personal knowledge management system for organizing interconnected notes, literature, and data.

## Structure

- **[Primary Notes](primary/index.qmd)**: Declarative notes with structured content (e.g., "X causes Y")
- **[Aggregator Notes](aggregators/index.qmd)**: Collections of notes organized by topic
- **Data**: Raw datasets for visualization and analysis

## Getting Started

Browse the primary notes to explore individual concepts, or check the aggregator notes to see thematic collections.
